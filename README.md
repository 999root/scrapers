# 999root's Webscrapers
- All of my webscrapers in 1 repo
- Direct downloads
# Why?
- Just practice to me for quick scripting abilities and understanding how the requests and BS4 modules work.
## RPCS3 Webscraper
- Scrapes results of games through the RPCS3 Compatibility searcher/list
## NPMJS Webscraper
- Scrapes search results of NPM packages
## Scroop
- Scrapes searches from scoop.sh
## Installation Notes
- Run the setup.py file before the compile.py file so pyinstaller is pre-installed but if you already have it installed it wont matter but run it anyway so the requests and beautifulsoup4 modules are downloaded/updated
- Can skip this by downloading the EXE File
- Drag the EXE file into your 'System32' folder so it can become callable via cmd
